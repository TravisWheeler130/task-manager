# Task Manager Console App

This project is a simple C++ console application that allows users to manage a list of tasks. The app supports adding, viewing, editing, completing, and deleting tasksâ€”all from a user-friendly terminal interface. It was built as part of my personal software portfolio to strengthen my skills in structuring interactive, menu-based programs in C++.
